## SDK support tiers

Kalix supports a wide variety of programming languages through Kalix Software Development Kits (SDKs). These SDKs are built by Lightbend, its partners, and the Kalix community.

The table below shows the language SDKs that are currently available, their support status, supported versions, and a link to the source code.

- Incubating (Tier 2): For use in development, not covered by Lightbend's support policy.
- Community-driven (Tier 3): For use in development and not covered by Lightbend's support policy. Be aware that the SDK might not support all available Kalix features and might not be appropriate for use in production.

Lightbend and authorized partners handle Tier 1 support as defined in Lightbend's official support policy. Tier 2 and Tier 3 support is on a best-effort basis without guarantees or timelines and is handled by Lightbend, its partners, and the community.
